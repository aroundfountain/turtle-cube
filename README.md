This is a project I made for fun. It uses hard-coded coordinates to draw a cube using python's "turtle" module, a rudimentary graphics engine.
It then calculates the distance the cube should be from the camera and scales it accordingly, before calculating, using the sine and cosine of the cube's axes, its current angle.
We draw it 360 times. If you really wanted to, you could change the variables yourself, but I have not tested the code with non-cube shapes.
